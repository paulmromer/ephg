                <div class="letter-heading">
                    Dear Mr Dominic Raab, Sir Keir Starmer, Mr Jeremy Hunt, Mr Matt Hancock, Mr Jonathan Ashworth,
                    Professors Sir Patrick Vallance, Chris Whitty and John Newton,
                </div>

                <div class="letter-body">
                    <p>
                        The British public have so far been offered the strategy of alternating periods of lockdown and
                        relaxation of restrictions. However, extended periods of lockdown will increase economic and
                        social damage, and periods of relaxation of restrictions are almost certainly going to trigger
                        further epidemic waves of fatalities. We strongly support expanding testing as quickly as
                        possible, building up local public health teams to get our systems in place for case detection
                        and contact tracing. We note however that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission may be a
                        major factor in the epidemic. The resurgence can be slowed by contact tracing, behavioural
                        changes and various degrees of physical distancing but it cannot be stopped. These cycles will
                        kill tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands of people before a vaccine becomes available, and
                        the most disadvantaged will suffer most.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As experienced public health researchers and practitioners we believe there is an alternative
                        strategy that can restore normal life and economic recovery: universal repeated testing. We
                        strongly recommend evaluation of weekly Covid-19 antigen testing of the whole population in an
                        entire city as a demonstration site (preferably several towns and cities if funding is
                        available), with strict household quarantine following a positive test. Visitors are allowed but
                        are quarantined on arrival. Quarantine ends when all residents test negative at the same time.
                        Lockdown will end immediately for everyone else, although some may choose to remain isolated.
                        This should be assessed for feasibility in one or more cities with populations of ~200,000.
                        Ending lockdown with weekly testing is likely to suppress viral transmission while restoring
                        normal life. Such a feasibility study could begin immediately with Government support. The study
                        will have begun after lockdown so the initial infection rate will be fairly low. The rate at
                        which it then rises or falls will be apparent within a few weeks. A decision can then be taken
                        on national roll-out, beginning in high-risk areas and limited only by reagent supplies. If this
                        works hundreds of thousands of lives of people living in the UK may be saved, not to mention NHS
                        intensive care overload and the miseries of lockdown and unemployment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The site(s) should be selected in consultation with local health and administrative authorities.
                        Public awareness and implementation will be organised by a community advisory committee led by
                        local public health specialists and PHE consultants in communicable disease control. To
                        establish the feasibility of national roll-out all tests will be performed by staff in local
                        academic or commercial labs with PCR machines currently used for other purposes. A city of
                        200,000 with 90% compliance will require 26,000 tests per day, plus a small increase to offer
                        daily antigen testing for NHS staff and care workers. Such a study can be done without
                        encroachments on privacy rights and with the consent of the population. Other requirements for
                        the feasibility study are a population register of the city, self-sample kits and a system for
                        delivering and collecting samples (see below).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Whatever the results these data will enable policy to be based on real-time evidence (instead of
                        modelling assumptions) on new infection rates in the expanding regularly tested population and
                        the untested remainder. The latter can be monitored by testing population samples as well as by
                        NHS number linkage to hospital diagnoses and GP records. Complementary and alternative
                        strategies including contact tracing and mobile phone apps will be particularly important in the
                        unscreened population, and may enable testing to be done less frequently as prevalence falls.
                        Local public health staff supported by volunteers will assist in developing, implementing and
                        evaluating these as well as supporting public information, home visits and helplines. To
                        minimise disruption, access to the city would be unrestricted with occasional testing of
                        incomers at temporary checkpoints. Testing would be voluntary, but imposing penalties for
                        breaching quarantine following a positive test in a household could be considered. Helplines
                        would be provided for quarantined households for exemption requests, loss of income compensation
                        and food delivery.

                    <h3> National roll-out:</h3>

                    <p>
                        If the epidemic is controlled without lockdown in the feasibility study, public pressure for
                        national roll-out will be irresistible. A ballpark cost-benefit analysis shows a total cost per
                        year following national roll-out of £14 billion, the most speculative components being £100
                        million to expand facilities for manufacturing reagents and £2 per test for PCR reagents (£7
                        billion per year for 10 million tests per day). This is a small fraction of the economic costs
                        of lockdown. Chemical manufacturers rather than clinical test companies must be involved to
                        limit costs and ensure supplies. Quality control can be minimal because PCR is sensitive and any
                        false negatives tend to be the least infectious cases, and because both false negatives and
                        false positives will be retested a week later.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Universal repeat testing has been dismissed as impractical because so many tests are required
                        and because it has never been tried. Each of the imagined obstacles is simply a shortage that
                        can be met, perhaps quite quickly, by (preferably British) manufacturers.
                    </p>

                        <h3> The facilities needed are:</h3>

                        <ol>
                            <li>A register of names, dates of birth and addresses of all residents registered with a GP,
                                to be updated as necessary with test results, changes of address and addition of
                                unregistered subjects. Anonymous registration with local outlets for sample collection
                                and delivery is needed for those reluctant to give name and address.</li>
                            <li>The equivalent of 14,000 96-well PCR machines running night and day. Enough machines and
                                experienced staff to operate them are already in place in large and small academic and
                                commercial labs throughout the UK, including possible demonstration sites. Posts for
                                three 8-hour shifts might be needed.</li>
                            <li>Self-sample swabs, sample transport tubes individually labelled with name, date of birth
                                and barcoded ID, PCR reagents and microtiter plates for 10 million tests per day.
                                Additional production facilities must be commissioned if necessary.</li>
                            <li>Arrangements to deliver and collect samples from every household once a week, with
                                delivery to a testing lab within a few hours. Results would be entered online by the lab
                                within a day of sample collection. Positive results in those without phone or email
                                would be delivered by courier.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This high throughput would depend on various regulatory emergency waivers:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Lab staff would wear PPE where necessary but would not be accredited to conduct medical
                                tests.</li>
                            <li>Laboratories would be advised on precautions but not accredited for handling infectious
                                samples.</li>
                            <li>PCR reagent production with normal non-medical quality control cannot be hampered by
                                patents or regulations on medical test manufacture.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The idea of conducting regular population-wide mass testing, which has never been tried in a
                        large country, is unusual in two respects. First, a voluntary “Dunkirk spirit” collaboration of
                        all university and commercial labs that already have the necessary equipment (a PCR machine) is
                        the only way for 10 million tests to be done daily. Second, manufacture and testing would be
                        arranged in consultation with chemical manufacturers rather than clinical test companies and
                        exempt from regulatory requirements on medical testing. This requires emergency legislation.
                    </p>
